            <em><b>Study Area:</b></em>
        <p>The paper identifies the integrated groundwater potential area. The Kathan watershed is 1,341 square
            kilometers and is part of the Chhatarpur district. The Chhatarpur district is in the northern part of Madhya
            Pradesh and covers 8,687 square kilometers.</p>

        <p>
            Convectional cropping pattern and agricultural practices do not seem adequate during the periods of weather
            aberrations. Apart from that as per the land capability classification system capability classes I to IV
            along with
            gentle and moderate slope, supporting lithology, geomorphology and suitable groundwater condition are found
            suitable for agricultural practices beyond that they are unsuitable for conventional agricultural use.
            Kathan
            watershed comprises 11.59 Km2 of land, which is under cultivation despite of unsuitable due to social and
            economic problems. The alternate agriculture or management practices suggested are double cropping, agro</p>

            <p><em><b>Forest Lands Management:</b></em></p>
            A forest is a large area of land covered with trees or other woody vegetation. Hundreds of more precise
            definitions of forest are used throughout the world, incorporating factors such as tree density, tree
            height, land
            use, legal standing and ecological function. Land provides an environment for agricultural production, but
            it also
            is an essential condition for improved environmental management, including source/sink functions for
            greenhouse gasses, recycling of nutrients, amelioration and filtering of pollutants, and transmission and
            purification of water as part of the hydrologic cycle. The objective of sustainable land management (SLM)is
            to
            harmonize the complimentary goals of providing environmental, economic, and social opportunities for the
            benefit of present and future generations, while maintaining and enhancing the quality of the land (soil,
            water
            and air) resource (Smyth and Dumanski, 1993). Sustainable land management is the use of land to meet
            changing human needs (agriculture, forestry, conservation), while ensuring long -term socioeconomic and
            ecological functions of the land.
